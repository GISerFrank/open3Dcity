Reconstructing 3D city models from street view images.

# This is an exercise of using markdown grammar.

## It's been so long since the last time I learned it.

### Hence I reach out to Chatgpt for help.

#### Unsurprisingly, it goes firstly with Headers.

##### I believe it won't take too much time to recap the basic grammar.

###### Even if not, I have ultimate weapon: Chatgpt.

# Oops! I forgot to specify the grammar. So level 1 title starts with "#", level 2 title starts with "##", level 3 title starts with "###", ... I believe you've noticed the regularity. Let's move on.

# Here comes the second part: **Emphasis**. We can use **BOLD**("\*\*") or *Italic*("\*"). Also, we can combine them together like ***this***("\*\*\*").

# Now we're going to do something different: ***Lists***.

# There are two types of lists: 
  - unordered list
  1. ordered list
  ## The tip to remember this is ordered list starts with numbers, while unordered list starts with none(-).

# **Links** is also a big part, yet with easy grammar. We just put description into a "[]" followed by a "()" containing the link.
  ## For example:
  1. [Google](https://www.google.com)
  2. [Baidu](https://www.baidu.com)

  ## As for Images, it's quite similar to how we deal with **links**:
  ## ![Description](link of image)

# If we want to use **blockquotes**, we should use ">":
  > This is a quote.

# Here's another big part that we should be so accustomed to: ***Code***.
 ## We have two different ways to present our codes:
 1. This is `code in line`, which uses "`". 
 2. This is
    ```code in block
    code in block
    ```code in block
    ,which uses "```".

# Want to construct a table in .md file? No worry! We can use `|` to seperate columns, and `-` to seperate headers and content.
  ## Here's an example:
  | cl1 | cl2 | cl3 |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | data1 | data2 | data3 |

---

# Have you noticed what happened? Exactly! Here's a horizontal rule above! You can draw it with "***" or "---". It's up to you!

# Now we're heading to the last grammar: Task Lists. Task to be done -> "- [ ]"; Task finished -> "- [x]" 
  ## Examples are as following:
  - [ ] md grammar is so easy!
  - [x] I need more practice.

# That's all! Feel free to begin with your firsr md file right away!(or anytime you want)
